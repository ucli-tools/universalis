- How do you want to monetize (if at all)?
- What are your legal requirements?

### Step 2: Set Up Your Structure
```bash
# Clone the tools you need
git clone https://github.com/ucli-tools/universalis
cd universalis/examples/

# Choose your example
cp -r academic_setup my-implementation
# or
cp -r dual_licensing_setup my-implementation
# or
cp -r basic_setup my-implementation
```

### Step 3: Customize Your Implementation
- Update licensing documentation
- Modify content structure
- Customize branding and styling
- Configure build and deployment

### Step 4: Create Your Content
- Follow the content guidelines
- Include proper metadata
- Test the build process
- Verify the output quality

### Step 5: Deploy and Iterate
- Deploy to your chosen platform
- Gather user feedback
- Iterate on your implementation
- Contribute back to the community
